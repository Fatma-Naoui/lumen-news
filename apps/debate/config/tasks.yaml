    ARTICLE TO ANALYZE:
    {article_text}

    PREVIOUS DEBATE CONTEXT:
    {context}

    YOUR TASK:
    {% if context and 'OPPOSER' in context %}
    ROUND 2 - You must respond to the opposer's challenges:
    1. DO NOT simply repeat your previous arguments
    2. Directly address each of the opposer's red flags
    3. Either refute them with evidence, or concede but minimize their impact
    4. Introduce NEW evidence or perspectives

    For each opposer concern:
    - Quote their specific claim
    - Provide a direct counter-argument with evidence
    - Explain why your interpretation is more valid

    Example: "While you raised concerns about [X], I believe this is actually [counter-argument] because [evidence]."
    {% else %}
    ROUND 1 - Present your opening arguments:
    Present 3 strong arguments for why this article appears credible.

    Structure each argument as:
    "I believe this article is credible because of [FACTOR]. [Specific evidence]. [Why this matters]."

    Focus on:
    - SOURCE CREDIBILITY: Publication reputation, author credentials
    - LANGUAGE QUALITY: Professional tone, clear writing, proper citations
    - FACTUAL CONSISTENCY: Verifiable claims, corroborating evidence
    {% endif %}

    Keep your response conversational and under 200 words. Do NOT start with phrases like "I now can give a great answer" or "Thought:" - jump straight into your arguments.

    You are challenging the credibility of this article.

    ARTICLE TO ANALYZE:
    {article_text}

    DEFENDER'S ARGUMENTS:
    {context}

    YOUR TASK:
    {% if context and 'Round 2' in context %}
    ROUND 2 - Push back against the defender's rebuttals:
    1. DO NOT simply repeat your Round 1 red flags
    2. Address the defender's counter-arguments directly
    3. Show why their rebuttals are weak or insufficient
    4. Deepen your critique with additional evidence

    For each defender rebuttal:
    - Acknowledge what they said
    - Explain why it doesn't resolve your concern
    - Provide additional evidence that strengthens your red flag

    Example: "You claimed [X], but this doesn't address the core issue because [reasoning]. In fact, [additional evidence]."
    {% else %}
    ROUND 1 - Identify red flags:
    Identify 3 specific red flags that challenge the article's credibility. Address the defender's points directly.

    Structure each red flag as:
    "[Specific element] is suspicious BECAUSE [concrete evidence and reasoning]."

    Focus on:
    - MANIPULATION PATTERNS: Loaded language, emotional appeals, misleading framing
    - VERIFICATION GAPS: Missing sources, unverifiable claims, lack of counterpoints
    - BIAS INDICATORS: One-sided reporting, selective facts, editorialized language
    {% endif %}

    Keep your response conversational and under 200 words. Quote specific text from the article. Do NOT start with phrases like "I now can give a great answer" or "Final Answer:" - jump straight into your arguments.
